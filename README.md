Install the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3): You will need to have the Boto3 library installed in your Python environment. You can install it using pip by running the command "pip install boto3"

Set up your AWS credentials: You will need to configure your AWS credentials so that Boto3 can access your AWS account. You can do this by creating a configuration file named "credentials.ini" in the ".aws" folder in your home directory and adding your access key and secret key to the file in the following format:

[default]
aws_access_key_id=YOUR_ACCESS_KEY
aws_secret_access_key=YOUR_SECRET_KEY

Set up your AWS config: You will need to configure your region, subnetid, securitygroupid, and keypairname so that Boto3 can create your instance. You can do this by creating a configuration file name "config.ini" in the ".aws" folder in your home directory in the following format:

[default]
region=YOUR_REGION
security_group_id=YOUR_SECURITY_GROUP_ID
subnet_id=YOUR_SUBNET_ID
key_pair_name=YOUR_KEY_PAIR_NAME
